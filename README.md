# Student Grade Generator

## What it does

This is a simple program that asks you to enter a student's marks (between 0 and 100) and then gives you the corresponding grade. Here's how it works:

- **A**: 80 and above
- **B**: 60 - 79
- **C**: 50 - 59
- **D**: 40 - 49
- **E**: Below 40

It will make sure the number you enter is valid (between 0 and 100).

## How to Use

1. Copy the code into a JavaScript file or use your browser's console.
2. Run the program by calling the `gradeGenerator()` function.
3. Enter a student's marks when prompted.
4. It will then tell you the grade.
