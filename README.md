# Speed Detector

## What it does

This program takes the speed of a car as input and calculates how many demerit points the driver has earned based on how much they exceed the speed limit of 70 km/h.

- If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
- For every 5 km/h above 70, the driver gets 1 demerit point.
- If the driver earns more than 12 demerit points, their license gets suspended.

## How to Use

1. Copy the code into a JavaScript file or use your browser’s console.
2. Run the program by calling the `speedDetector()` function.
3. Enter the car's speed when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display whether the driver is okay or how many demerit points they’ve earned.

### Example:
